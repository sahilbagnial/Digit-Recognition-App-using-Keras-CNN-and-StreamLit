# Digit-Recognition-App-using-Keras-CNN-and-StreamLit
This project is a web app which was created using python. The webapp was created using StreamLit, which is an open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science to create beautiful data apps.<br/>
I trained CNN model on MNIST Digits dataset. This model was created using Keras which is ,yet again, an open-source library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks.<br/>
Using this model, the digits drawn in the webapps are predicted.<br/>
